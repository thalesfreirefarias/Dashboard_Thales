# Dashboard_Thales
Using what I learned in my latest Alura course, I built a new finance dashboard


Steps:
->python -m venv venv -> Create a Venv File
-> source venv/bin/activate activate Venv
->  pip install streamlit (we will need to start our Dashboard, if has a update continue installing)
-> pip install requests
-> pip install pandas
-> pip install plotly
-> streamlit run Dashboard.py
